# By default Nginx clears all environment variables (except TZ) for its child processes (Passenger being one of them). That's why any environment variables you set with docker run -e,
# Docker linking and /etc/container_environment, won't reach Nginx.
# To preserve these variables, place an Nginx config file ending with *.conf in the directory /etc/nginx/main.d, in which you tell Nginx to preserve these variables.
